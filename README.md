# Wipeout XL Recompiled

This release candidate uses PSXRecomp and the shared recomp-ui launcher.
You must supply your own SCUS-94351 game disc and SCPH-5502/5552 Europe BIOS.
The package contains no game disc, retail BIOS, generated retail game code, or saved game.

## Setup

1. Extract the complete setup ZIP into a writable folder.
2. Start `Wipeout_XL_Recompiled` (`.exe` on Windows).
3. Select your CUE file and the required BIOS in the setup wizard.
4. Run Generate & rebuild and wait for the game to start.

On Windows, the setup wizard can download the portable build tools.
On Linux and macOS, install CMake, Ninja, Python 3, and a C/C++ compiler first.
Keep the CUE and all files it references together.
The BIOS must be 524288 bytes with SHA-256 `1faaa18fa820a0225e488d9f086296b8e6c46df739666093987ff7d8fd352c09`.

## Candidate status
